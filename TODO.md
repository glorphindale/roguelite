Code
    * Refactor this mess

Worldgen

Entities
    * using posx/posy for GameObject is inconvenient, should be abstrated to 'position'

UI
    * Add mouse targeting for spells - unclear how to implement properly
    * Add visual feedback for combat - blood splatters, lightning effects
    * Properly describe equipment with stats

Inventory
    * Allow to equip items

Balance
    * EXP gain formula is bad
