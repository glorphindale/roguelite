# roguelite

Attempt to make a roguelike in Clojure by following /r/roguelikedev tutorial: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod

## Usage

> lein run

Use arrow keys to move, 'r' to start a new level, 'p' to pickup an item, 'u' to use an item.

## Notes

Uses a tileset built for Dwarf Fortress (taken from http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Bisasam_16x16_preview.png)

## TODO

* Show walls with different characters (Impossible with current tileset, and probably with Quil - need proper tile drawing)
